================================

This project is designed to allow people to pick up the included resources and teach a basic 1 hour lesson on some of the core concepts of programming within Python.

This is very much a beginner session however it is designed to be accessible. We are targetting this at teachers who want to learn Python in order to teach it under the new UK curriculum or at students who want a quick HOWTO on the basics of programming or python.

This session is regularly held in Bristol at the DigiMakers events held at @Bristol by the Bristol University Computer Science department. Search EventBrite and the Bristol University websites for DigiMakers for details of our next session.

Tutorials initially written by Thomas Mortensson and Ben Collins with support from Graham Laming. Thanks go to Robert Briggs for initial Latex support.

Session has been tested 7 times to date as of 23/11/2013.
